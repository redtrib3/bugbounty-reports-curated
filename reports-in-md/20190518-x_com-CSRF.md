# Periscope android app deeplink leads to CSRF in follow action

**Target**: x.com

**Reported on**: hackerone

**Bug Type**: CSRF

**Severity**: Low

## Summary
This report describes a potential CSRF vulnerability in Shopify's PayPal integration. 
The `merchantId` parameter, which links a store to a PayPal account, functions as a static secret instead of a proper per-request CSRF token. 
If the `merchantId` is ever exposed (e.g., through logs or prior admin access), an attacker could craft a URL that tricks a store admin into connecting the attacker's PayPal account to the victim store. 
Exploitation is mostly theoretical due to the long, unguessable nature of the `merchantId`, but exposure of this static value would allow unauthorized linking of payment accounts.
