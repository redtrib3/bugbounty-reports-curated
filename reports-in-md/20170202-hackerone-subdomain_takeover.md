# Subdomain takeover at info.hacker.one

**Target**: hackerone

**Reported on**: hackerone

**Bug Type**: Subdomain takeover

**Severity**: Low

**Report URL**: https://hackerone.com/reports/202767

## Summary
The researcher discovered that the subdomain `info.hacker.one` had a CNAME entry pointing to `unbouncepages.com`, an external page hosting service.
By exploiting a 0-day vulnerability in Unbounce's API, it was possible to claim any domain pointing to the service, bypassing their normal ownership restrictions.
This allowed the attacker to fully control the subdomain and host arbitrary content, enabling phishing, credential theft, or other targeted attacks.
