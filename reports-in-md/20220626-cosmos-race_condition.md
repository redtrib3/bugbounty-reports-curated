# Race condition in faucet when using starport

**Target**: Cosmos

## Summary
A race condition exists in Starportâ€™s faucet implementation. The faucet is configured with a maximum token limit per user, but concurrent requests allow users to bypass this limit. In testing, Alice was able to receive 30 tokens despite the 11-token maximum. The root cause is the use of a Go map for tracking balances, which is unsafe for concurrent access.
