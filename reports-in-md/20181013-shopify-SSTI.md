# H1514 Server Side Template Injection in Return Magic email templates?

**Target**: Shopify

**Reported on**: hackerone

**Bug Type**: SSTI

**Severity**: Unspecified

**Report URL**: https://hackerone.com/reports/423541

## Summary
Shopify Return Magicâ€™s workflow email templates may be vulnerable to server-side template injection (SSTI). When inserting `{{this}}` or related expressions in email templates, the rendered output shows JavaScript objects, indicating server-side template rendering (likely Node.js) with access to internal objects. Exploitability is unclear, but the behavior suggests potential SSTI risk.
A similar vulnerability was reported on Shopify's return magic feature using the Smarty template engine. The researcher demonstrated that this could be escalated to a RCE.
