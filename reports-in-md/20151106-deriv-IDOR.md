# login to any user's cashier account and full account information disclosure

**Target**: Deriv

**Reported on**: hackerone

**Bug Type**: IDOR

**Severity**: High

**Report URL**: https://hackerone.com/reports/98247

## Summary
The vulnerability lies in the cashier functionality where the `PIN` parameter inside the `<iframe>` source URL is used to identify a user's account. Since this parameter is not properly validated server-side, an attacker can change its value to another user's account ID. Doing so grants unauthorized access to the victimâ€™s cashier account, exposing sensitive PII such as full name, email, and phone number, and allowing account takeover. This is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) leading to full compromise of user accounts and sensitive data disclosure.
