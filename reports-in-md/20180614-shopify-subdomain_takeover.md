# Subdomain Takeover - https://competition.shopify.com/

**Target**: shopify

**Reported on**: hackerone

**Bug Type**: Subdomain takeover

**Severity**: Medium

**Report URL**: https://hackerone.com/reports/365853

## Summary
The subdomain `competition.shopify.com` was pointing to `competition.shopify.com.herokudns.com` through a CNAME record, but the associated Heroku custom domain was unclaimed. This allowed the researcher to claim the domain in Heroku and host content on it as proof of concept. If exploited by a malicious actor, this could enable JavaScript execution for cookie theft or browser exploitation, phishing attacks using a trusted Shopify subdomain, site defacement, fake competition pages to harvest credit card details, or malware distribution and command-and-control operations. The recommended fix is either to reclaim the domain on Heroku or remove the DNS entry.
