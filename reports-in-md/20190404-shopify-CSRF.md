# CSRF on connecting Paypal as Payment Provider

**Target**: shopify

**Reported on**: hackerone

**Bug Type**: CSRF

**Severity**: Medium

**Report URL**: https://hackerone.com/reports/807924

## Summary
A potential CSRF vulnerability exists in Shopify's PayPal integration. 
The `merchantId` parameter, used to link a store to a PayPal account, acts as a static secret rather than a per-request CSRF token. 
If this value is ever exposed, an attacker could craft a URL that forces a store admin to connect the attacker's PayPal account to their store. 
Exploitation is largely theoretical since the `merchantId` is long and unguessable, but exposure of this static token would allow unauthorized linking of payment accounts.
