**Report URL**: https://hackerone.com/reports/209004

## Summary
Following the fix for the original takeover of `info.hacker.one`(20170202-hackerone-subdomain_takeover.yaml), the researcher discovered a bypass in Unbounce's platform that allowed the subdomain to be claimed again.
The vulnerability was in the `/[account-id]/pages/[page-id]` endpoint, where the `page[domain]` parameter could be modified to point any branded domain to attacker-controlled content.
This issue not only affected `info.hacker.one` but also exposed all branded domains under UnbouncePages to potential subdomain takeover.
Exploitation could allow phishing, credential theft, and other malicious activities targeting affected organizations.
