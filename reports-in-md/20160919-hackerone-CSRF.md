# Slack integration setup lacks CSRF protection

**Target**: hackerone

**Reported on**: hackerone

**Bug Type**: CSRF

**Severity**: High

**Report URL**: https://hackerone.com/reports/170552

## Summary
This report describes a potential CSRF vulnerability in HackerOne's OAuth integrations for teams. 
While the Slack integration uses a `state` parameter, the security of the flow relies on third-party (Slack) protections. 
If an attacker can exploit an XSS, Login CSRF, or clickjacking vulnerability in the third-party service, they could control the OAuth flow and connect their own account to a victim's HackerOne account. 
The risk is mostly theoretical today but could grow if additional integrations or login providers are added in the future.
