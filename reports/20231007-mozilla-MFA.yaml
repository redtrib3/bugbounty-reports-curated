title: Account deletion using the /v1/account/destroy API endpoint using account password without 2FA verification
target: Mozilla
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: MFA
severity: Medium
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/2197244
summary: |
  The account deletion endpoint at POST /v1/account/destroy does not check for 2FA and doesn't require an authorization header. Therefore, an unauthenticated attacker who knows the password of a user can delete their account without the need of 2FA.
  The reported was able to show more impact by providing information that the ratelimiting is implemented on a account basis and not IP, and also availablility of a new 1 Billion+ credential breach data on Firefox during that time.
