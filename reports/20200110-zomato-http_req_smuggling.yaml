title: "Stealing Zomato X-Access-Token: in Bulk using HTTP Request Smuggling on api.zomato.com"
target: Zomato
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: HTTP request smuggling
severity: Critical
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/740037
summary: |
  A CL.TE HTTP request smuggling vulnerability was discovered on api.zomato.com due to inconsistent parsing of `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers between Akamai (frontend) and backend servers. By exploiting this desync using a malformed `Transfer-Encoding:\tchunked` header, an attacker could poison backend requests and force victim connections to redirect to attacker-controlled endpoints. This enabled theft of `X-Access-Token` headers at scale, leading to full account takeover and mass PII exposure. The issue was patched at the Akamai layer and affected tokens were revoked.
