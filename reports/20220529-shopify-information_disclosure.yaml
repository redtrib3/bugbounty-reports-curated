title: "Information disclosure ( Google Sales Channel )"
target: Shopify
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: Information Disclosure
severity: Low
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/1584718
summary: |
  The vulnerability affects Shopify stores using the Google Sales Channel. Even if a store is protected with a password, attackers can query the endpoint `google-shopping.shopifycloud.com/shopify/products?shop=<store>&id=<product_id>&locale=en` with a valid product ID. The response discloses sensitive information including the `data-channel-id` and the `data-user-email` associated with the store. 
  This bypasses the intended privacy protections of password-protected stores and leaks sensitive identifiers and email addresses, which could be abused for targeted phishing, account takeover attempts, or large-scale data harvesting. For non-password-protected stores, exploitation is even easier since product IDs can be enumerated or discovered. 
  The root cause is insufficient access control on Shopifyâ€™s Google Sales Channel integration, leading to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive store and user information.
