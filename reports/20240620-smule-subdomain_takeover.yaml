title: Possible Subdomain Takeover For Inbound Emails
target: smule
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: Subdomain takeover
severity: Unspecified
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/2567048
summary: |
  The subdomain `email.smule.com` points to `sendgrid.net` via a CNAME record, but the linked SendGrid resource is unclaimed. 
  This allows an attacker to register the subdomain on SendGrid and take control of it. Since SendGrid is used for email marketing, 
  an attacker could potentially intercept inbound emails, send phishing messages, or abuse the domainâ€™s reputation for further attacks. 
  The issue requires no authentication, has medium risk, and is moderately easy to exploit. The recommended fix is to remove unused DNS entries or configure the external service to correctly handle the subdomain.
