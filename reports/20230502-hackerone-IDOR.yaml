title: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) - Delete Campaigns 
target: hackerone
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: IDOR
severity: High
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/1969141
summary: |
  A researcher found a vulnearbility in a graphql api endpoint that lets a user delete a campaign by manipulating the campaign_id parameter.
  The campaign_id takes a base64 of the string - `gid://hackerone/Campaign/244`. On changing the number 244 to another valid campaign (which is guessable),
  the respective campaign is deleted.
