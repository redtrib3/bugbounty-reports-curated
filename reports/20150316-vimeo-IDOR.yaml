summary: |
  The researcher found an IDOR vulnerablity that enabled a user to reveal private comments on a video by just knowing its comment ID - knowing comment_id is a precondition.
  This is by editing an attacker posted comment from attacker account, intercepting the request and changing the comment_id get parameter in the request `GET /122303200?comment_id=<CHANGE_THIS>&is_sticky=0&action=comment_edit_form HTTP/1.1`.
