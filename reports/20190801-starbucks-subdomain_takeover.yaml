title: Subdomain takeover of datacafe-cert.starbucks.com
target: starbucks
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: Subdomain takeover
severity: High
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/665398
summary: |
  The researcher found a subdomain owned by Starbucks - datacafe-cert.starbucks.com, having a CNAME record pointing to an unclaimed Azure web service at azurewebsites.net. This meant that the subdomain was dangling: it still pointed to an Azure app that no longer existed.
  By registering the same app name on Azure (e.g., datacafe-cert.azurewebsites.net), the researcher was able to take control of the Starbucks subdomain. This allowed them to serve content under *.starbucks.com, effectively achieving a subdomain takeover 
  a high-severity vulnerability due to the potential for phishing, cookie theft, or internal application abuse.
