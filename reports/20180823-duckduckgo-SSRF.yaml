title: SSRF on duckduckgo.com/iu/
target: DuckDuckGo
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: SSRF
severity: High
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/398641
summary: |
  The researcher on testing noticed a parameter `u` in https://duckduckgo.com/iu?u=yimg.com with the value `yimg.com` being sent randomly.
  Any other domain other than yimg.com being there, returned an error. the vulnerability was that the `u` parameter was simply checking for the existence of the yimg.com string in the parameter `u` value.
  This resulted in a SSRF as it enables an attacker to access internal resources, or request external website (all you have to do is add the yimg as a string to the malicious `u` value.)
  This also has the potential for  Cross-site-port scanning attack.
