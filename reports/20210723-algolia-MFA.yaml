title: Information disclosure -> 2fa bypass -> POST exploitation 
target: algolia
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: MFA
severity: Medium
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/1276373
summary: |
  The researcher found vulnerability in a webapp that let's an attacker bypass 2FA by knowning a sensitive secret - `gauth_secret` that is leaked on the response when requesting 2FA renew from an account.
  The leaked gauth_secret could be used on google authenticator to create codes that can directly be used to pass MFA. Although it doesn't have a direct impact, a account takeover is possible if the gauth_token of a user is leaked somehow.
