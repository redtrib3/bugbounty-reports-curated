title: Server Side Template Injection on Name parameter during Sign Up process
target: Glovo
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: SSTI
severity: High
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/1104349
summary: |
  The researcher found a SSTI vulnerability in the username field during signup. On registering with the username `{{7*7}}`, the researcher noticed that the welcome email reflected the output `49`.
  The researcher also points out that further testing could not be done as the initial exploitation seems to have broke the code in the backend, as a result no more welcome emails were being sent, affecting availability.
