summary: |
  In Grok AI, after free credits ran out, the account with premium features remained active for 30 minutes, 
  allowing non-paying users to consume premium resources.

  The researcher reported this and was initially marked as "informative", but the underlying impact was more severe.

  They identified two undocumented parameters:
  - `n`: Controls number of completions (1 < n < 128). Higher values generate more token output.
  - `temperature`: Controls randomness/detail in responses (0 < temp < 1). Higher values generate longer/more diverse outputs.

  Using an automated script within the 30-minute window, an attacker could theoretically consume resources worth up to 26.5 million USD.

  Fix likely involved disabling access immediately after quota exhaustion.
