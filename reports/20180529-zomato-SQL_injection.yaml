target: Zomato
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: SQL Injection (Boolean-based Blind)
severity: Critical
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/358669
summary: |
  There was an endpoint called `order_id` in zomato's website that was vulnerable to Boolean-based Blind SQL injection.
  Requesting `order_id='-if(1=2,'0','1')-'` changed the response length and on further investigation from the researcher,
  found out that the data could be dumped, using automated tools such as SQLmap.
