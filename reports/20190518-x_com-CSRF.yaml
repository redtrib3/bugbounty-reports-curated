title: Periscope android app deeplink leads to CSRF in follow action
target: x.com
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: CSRF
severity: Low

summary: |
  This report describes a potential CSRF vulnerability in Shopify's PayPal integration. 
  The `merchantId` parameter, which links a store to a PayPal account, functions as a static secret instead of a proper per-request CSRF token. 
  If the `merchantId` is ever exposed (e.g., through logs or prior admin access), an attacker could craft a URL that tricks a store admin into connecting the attacker's PayPal account to the victim store. 
  Exploitation is mostly theoretical due to the long, unguessable nature of the `merchantId`, but exposure of this static value would allow unauthorized linking of payment accounts.
