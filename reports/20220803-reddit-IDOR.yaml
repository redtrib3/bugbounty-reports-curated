target: reddit
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: IDOR
severity: High
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/1658418
summary: |
  There was a vulnerability in reddit's GraphQL endpoint that enables any user to see moderator logs of any subreddit. The vulnerability could be reproduced by logging in as any user,
  and sending a request to `gql.reddit.com` with the data - `{"id":"6243efcbc61d","variables":{"subredditName":"any-subreddit"}}`, This dumped the moderator logs of any subreddit the user mentions.
  If the moderator logs had multiple pages, the response had a `hasNextPage` boolean key value pair indicating that. to see the next page take teh endCursor code value from the first response and simply add the variable `"after": "code-from-endCursor"`.
