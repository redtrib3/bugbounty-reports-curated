title: Wordpress unzip_file path traversal
target: Wordpress
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: path traversal  
severity: Medium
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/205481
summary: |
  A researcher found out that the wordpress `unzip_file` function was vulnerable to path traversal as it enabled any attacker to overwrite any file in writable path using '../<filepath to overwrite>'. 
  The vulnerability existed as the `$to` parameter unzipped the file into any path without normalization of the input. The patch of this vulnerability was released in 4.8.2 (7 months since reporting.)
