target: hackerone
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: Subdomain takeover
severity: Low  
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/209004
summary: |
  Following the fix for the original takeover of `info.hacker.one`(20170202-hackerone-subdomain_takeover.yaml), the researcher discovered a bypass in Unbounce's platform that allowed the subdomain to be claimed again.
  The vulnerability was in the `/[account-id]/pages/[page-id]` endpoint, where the `page[domain]` parameter could be modified to point any branded domain to attacker-controlled content.
  This issue not only affected `info.hacker.one` but also exposed all branded domains under UnbouncePages to potential subdomain takeover.
  Exploitation could allow phishing, credential theft, and other malicious activities targeting affected organizations.
