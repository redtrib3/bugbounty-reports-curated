severity: Critical
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/915114
summary: |
  The researcher found a IDOR vulnerability in the user invite to a team feature in crowdsignal. If you click Edit button on any user of your team at 
  https://app.crowdsignal.com/users/list-users.php, you will send a GET request to https://app.crowdsignal.com/users/invite-user.php?id=(userid)&popup=1, the `id` parameter is vulnerable here 
  as it takes a numerical sequential number in range `00010006` to `19920500`. On sending a GET request to vulnerable endpoint, you will get a response with the victim email and the optional button to update permissions.
  on clicking that, we will successfully takeover the victim account.
