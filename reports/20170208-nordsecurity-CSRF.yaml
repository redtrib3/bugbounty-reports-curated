  This report describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in NordVPN's profile management page. 
  An attacker could craft a malicious webpage that, when visited by an authenticated user, automatically submits a form to change the victimâ€™s account password without their consent. 
  The vulnerability affects the password change functionality, potentially allowing account takeover if exploited. 
  A proof-of-concept HTML form demonstrating the attack was provided by the reporter.
