title: Worker container escape lead to arbitrary file reading in host machine [again]
target: Semmle
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: path traversal
severity: Critical

summary: |
  The researcher discovered that when both `lgtm.yml` and `.lgtm.yml` exist in a project, LGTM processes only `lgtm.yml` but keeps `.lgtm.yml` in the build directory. By creating a symlink named `.lgtm.yml` pointing to a host machine file, an attacker can cause LGTM to expose arbitrary host files after a successful build (e.g., /etc/passwd). This enables sensitive information disclosure from the underlying host.
