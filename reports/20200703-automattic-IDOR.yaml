title: IDOR when moving contents at CrowdSignal
target: automattic
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: IDOR
severity: High
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/915127
summary: |
    An IDOR in the “Move to” functionality allowed attackers to take over any user’s content by modifying the `actionable[]` parameter in a POST request. 
    With a free account, attackers could move victim content to their own account with limited control. With a team account, attackers could transfer victim content to 
    another account within their team, gaining full access. Content IDs are sequential, enabling easy enumeration. _This summary is generated using AI_
