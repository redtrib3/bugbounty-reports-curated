title: "[Grab Android/iOS] Insecure deeplink leads to sensitive information disclosure"
target: Grab
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: Information Disclosure
severity: High
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/401793
summary: |
  The Grab Passenger app exposes a deep link that loads arbitrary web pages inside an internal WebView
  (ZendeskSupportActivity). This WebView exposes a JavaScript interface named 'Android' with methods like `getGrabUser()`
  that return sensitive user data. Because the deep link allows an attacker to specify any URL, they can host a malicious
  page that calls these exposed methods to steal sensitive information without user consent. The issue arises due to
  lack of restrictions on loaded URLs and unrestricted access to sensitive native methods via the JavaScript interface.
