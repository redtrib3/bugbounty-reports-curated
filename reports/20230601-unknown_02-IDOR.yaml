target: private
reported_platform: bugcrowd
bug_type: IDOR
severity: High

summary: |
    The vulnerability was in the support ticket system's endpoint `/v2/my-support/ticket/{ticket_id}`, which used predictable numeric IDs and did not enforce proper authorization checks.
    By changing the `ticket_id` in the URL to another valid number, the researcher was able to view tickets submitted by other users, exposing private communications and potentially sensitive data. 
    This was reported as a P2 (High severity) issue on Bugcrowd and subsequently fixed. _This summary is generated using AI_
