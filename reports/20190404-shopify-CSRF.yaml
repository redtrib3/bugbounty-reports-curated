title: CSRF on connecting Paypal as Payment Provider
target: shopify
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: CSRF
severity: Medium
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/807924
summary: |
  A potential CSRF vulnerability exists in Shopify's PayPal integration. 
  The `merchantId` parameter, used to link a store to a PayPal account, acts as a static secret rather than a per-request CSRF token. 
  If this value is ever exposed, an attacker could craft a URL that forces a store admin to connect the attacker's PayPal account to their store. 
  Exploitation is largely theoretical since the `merchantId` is long and unguessable, but exposure of this static token would allow unauthorized linking of payment accounts.
