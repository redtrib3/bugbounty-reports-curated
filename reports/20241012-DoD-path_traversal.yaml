title: "Unauthenticated LFI (Local File Inclusion) using the symbol `!`"
target: U.S. Dept Of Defense
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: path traversal  
severity: Critical
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/2778380
summary: |
  The researcher found that the Jolokia endpoint `/jolokia/exec/com.sun.management:type=DiagnosticCommand/compilerDirectivesAdd/` is vulnerable to path traversal using `!` in directory names. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to read arbitrary local files on the server, including sensitive system files like /etc/passwd and /etc/crontab, potentially exposing configuration and application secrets.
