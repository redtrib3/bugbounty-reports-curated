severity: Unspecified
report_url: https://hackerone.com/reports/52635
summary: |
  The researcher found a CSRF bypass vulnerability in UniFi v3.2.10 - Router, the only CSRF protection present in the interface was checking wheather Referer header is present and
  if it matches the host where the system is running - `default: 127.0.0.1`. On removing the referer header, it successfully bypasses any CSRF protection on the entire interface.
