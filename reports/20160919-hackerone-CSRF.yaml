title: Slack integration setup lacks CSRF protection
target: hackerone
reported_platform: hackerone
bug_type: CSRF
severity: High

summary: |
  This report describes a potential CSRF vulnerability in HackerOne's OAuth integrations for teams. 
  While the Slack integration uses a `state` parameter, the security of the flow relies on third-party (Slack) protections. 
  If an attacker can exploit an XSS, Login CSRF, or clickjacking vulnerability in the third-party service, they could control the OAuth flow and connect their own account to a victim's HackerOne account. 
  The risk is mostly theoretical today but could grow if additional integrations or login providers are added in the future.
